# JustSomeFlaskproject

For beginners of Flask, You guys can view this code and see how they works.
I just touched flask for about a week and this is what I have :)

Before you run, try to install all of the libraries by using CMD and type pip install [package]

The code is not clean yet, I always tried to use pascal convention but the code of the libraries comes with all sort of code convention which it made it difficult :(

This code is still not ready to run any server yet since I don't have money to rent any server and is unwise to do so as well.
